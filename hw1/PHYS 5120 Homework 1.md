## 1. The Linear and nonlinear pendulums

## 1.1 

The equation of motion is in the format of:

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d^2 \theta}}{\mathrm{d} t^2} + \frac{g}{\ell}\theta = 0$$.

And the solution of the differential equation is:

$$\theta =  A \cos (\sqrt\frac{g}{\ell} t + \delta)$$.

There are two parameters $A, \delta$ in the solution because we do not know the initial condition $\theta(t=0), \dot{\theta}(t=0)$.

The swing period is:

$$T = 2\pi \sqrt\frac{\ell}{g}$$.
